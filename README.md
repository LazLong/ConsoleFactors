Console Factors

This is a simple console application to save a little time when playing Beltmatic. Provide it with the target value and the highest mineable value available and it'll provide you with the factors to produce it. It's only looking at multiplication, addition and subtraction at this stage. Planning to add support for exponentials at some point.
